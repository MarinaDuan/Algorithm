# Algorithom & Data structure
Algorithms solve problems efficiently.
Data stuctures: containers used in problem solving, helping us process a large amount of data and information "efficiently"

Usually it is impossible to optimize time performance and space consumption at the same time.
There are usually two indicators for evaluating the performance of an algorithm, execution time and memory consumption.Usually in the field of the server side, we are more concerned about the execution time, because the memory consumption can be recovered, and the user does not care how much space is used to execute a program on the server side. 
execution operations for small data size

In the above Cartesian coordinate system, the horizontal axis nn Indicates the scale of the data, the vertical axis Y Indicates the running time of the program. But it is inaccurate to observe the trend of complexity only under small-scale test cases. Now we scale up the data to100000100000, in order to accommodate these functions in the same Cartesian coordinate system, we scale down the more complex functions (change the base of the logarithm from 22 change to 1010 ï¼Œn^2 shrink to original 1\10000
